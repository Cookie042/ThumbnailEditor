# ThumbnailEditor

Simply place the Editor folder into the project, 
after a recompile you will see a new menu named 'Cookie Jar > Thumbnail Renderer'

once you've opened the UI you can **Drag and Drop** prefab objects 
from the project or the scene heirarchy into the PrefabObject list

A Scene GUI will render the currently active object in the list, marked by a blue bar to the left
as well as show the position of the camera being used for that prefab
